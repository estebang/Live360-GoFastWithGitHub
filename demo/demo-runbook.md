# ▶️ DEMO 1 — CI Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
**Slides:** GitHub Actions → Workflow Anatomy → Demo: CI Pipeline  
**Duration:** ~5 minutes  
**Goal:** Build & test .NET app, cache packages, run on PR  

## Live Steps
1. GitHub → Actions → “Set up a workflow yourself”  
2. Open YAML in VS Code  
3. Copilot prompt:

```
Create a CI workflow for this .NET 9 Razor Pages application.
It should run on push and pull_request, restore dependencies,
build, test, and cache NuGet packages.
```

4. Commit and push  
5. Show workflow run  

## Expected Output
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`  
- Workflow runs on PR  
- Build + test successful  

## Fallback
Checkout `demo/ci-start`

---

# ▶️ DEMO 2 — Copilot Improves CI/CD
**Slides:** Copilot for DevOps → Demo: Copilot Improves CI/CD  
**Duration:** 6–8 minutes  
**Goal:** Expand CI → CD and deploy to Azure  

## Live Steps
1. Open `ci.yml`  
2. Copilot prompt:

```
Expand this workflow to deploy the TailspinToys.Web project
to my Azure Web App. Use OIDC (OpenID Connect). Deploy only on push to main.
Add build, publish, and deploy steps.

Use the following secret names: AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID

And use these variable names: AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME_DEV, AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME_PROD
```

3. Review → commit → push  
4. Show Azure deployment  

## Expected Output
- CI expanded into CI/CD  
- Publish + deploy steps added  

## Fallback
Use `demo/cd-ready`

---

# ▶️ DEMO 3 — Agent Mode Builds Full CI/CD Pipeline
**Slides:** Agent Mode → Demo: Agent Mode & Pipeline  
**Duration:** ~7 minutes  
**Goal:** Full pipeline generated by Agent Mode  

## Live Steps
VS Code → Agent Mode:

```
Analyze this repository and create a complete CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
Include:
- build and test for .NET 8
- dev and prod environments
- deploy to Azure using OIDC
- reusable code patterns
- comments explaining the workflow
```

Accept plan → apply changes → commit → push  

## Expected Output
- Updated/split CI + CD workflows  
- Environment structure created  

## Fallback
Use `demo/agent-start`

---

# ▶️ DEMO 4 — MCP in VS Code
**Slides:** MCP → SDLC Queries  
**Duration:** 6–8 minutes  
**Goal:** Show Issue/PR/workflow understanding in IDE  

## Live Steps

### Query Issues
```
Using the GitHub MCP server, list all open issues for this repository
and summarize them.
```

### Investigate Issue #1
```
Show me the details of Issue #1 and the workflow runs related to it.
```

### Analyze PR #1
```
Summarize PR #1 and determine whether it fixes Issue #1.
```

### Recommend fix
```
Recommend the changes required to fix the problem in Issue #1 and show
the workflow file that needs updating.
```

## Expected Output
- Issue + PR summaries  
- Workflow run diagnostics  

## Fallback
Use GitHub UI manually

---

# ▶️ DEMO 5 — Custom Agent
**Slides:** Custom Agents → Demo: Custom Agent  
**Duration:** 5–7 minutes  
**Goal:** Apply organizational standards via automation  

## Live Steps

```
Evaluate this repository against our Tailspin DevOps standards.
Ensure we have:
- CI workflow
- CD workflow
- dev/prod environments
- Azure deployment steps
- GHAS scanning if missing
- Dependabot config

Make any required changes and open a pull request summarizing what changed.
```

## Expected Output
- PR titled “Apply Tailspin DevOps Standards”

## Fallback
Open prepared PR in `demo/custom-agent`

# 🎉 DEMO FINALE — Idea → Azure

**Narrative:**
"We went from idea to Azure deployment using GitHub Actions, Copilot, Agent Mode, MCP, and Custom Agents — a fully agentic delivery workflow."

Open Azure Web App → show app running.

---

# 🧹 Troubleshooting & Recovery

- **Actions slow:** switch to a backup branch  
- **Azure fail:** use publish profile  
- **Agent Mode hangs:** reduce prompt scope  
- **MCP rate limit:** use GitHub UI
